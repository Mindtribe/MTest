											"arguments": "",
											"description": "This query command reads the power supply’s identification string. The power supply returns four fields separated by commas. The first field is the manufacturer’s name, the second field is the model number, the third field is not used (always '0'), and the fourth field is a revision code which contains three numbers. The first number is the firmware revision number for the main power supply processor; the second is for the input/output processor; and the third is for the front-panel processor. The command returns a string with the following format (be sure to dimension a string variable with at least 40 characters): HEWLETT-PACKARD,E3633A or E3634A,0,X.X-X.X-X.X"

						"get_version": 	{ 
											"commandString": "SYSTem:VERSion?",
											"arguments": "",
											"description": "This command queries the power supply to determine the present SCPI version. The returned value is of a string in the form YYYY.V where the “Y’s” represent the year of the version, and the “V” represents a version number for that year (for example, 1995.0)."

											"arguments": "output {OFF|ON}",
											"description": "This command enables or disables all three outputs of the power supply. The state of the disabled outputs is a condition of less than 0.6 volts of opposite polarity with no load and less than 60 mA of opposite direction with a short circuit. At *RST, the output state is off."

						"set_voltage": 	{ 
											"commandString": "VOLTage %s",
											"arguments": "voltage {<voltage>}",
											"description": "This command directly programs the immediate voltage level of the power supply. The immediate level is the voltage limit value of the selected output with the INSTrument command."

											"description": "This command is combination of INSTrument:SELect, [SOURce:] VOLTage, and [SOURce:]CURRent commands. The values of voltage and the current of the specified output are changed as soon as the command is executed. You can identify each output by the output name (P6V, P25V or N25V) as described in Table 4-1. For the voltage and current parameters of the APPLy command, the ranges depend on the output currently selected. You can substitute “MINimum”, “MAXimum”, or “DEFault” in place of a specific value for the voltage and current parameters. MIN selects the lowest voltage and current values allowed for the selected output. MAX selects the highest voltage and current values allowed. The default voltage values are 0 volts for all outputs. The default current values are 5 A for +6V output and 1 A for ±25V outputs. The default voltage and current values are exactly the same as the *RST values. See Table 4-1 for details of parameters. If you specify only one value for the parameter, the power supply regards it as voltage setting value. If you do not specify any value for the parameter, the APPLy command only selects the output specified and acts as the INSTrument command."

											"commandString": "INSTrument:SELect %s",
											"arguments": "output {P6V|P25V|N25V}",
											"description": "This command selects the output to be programmed among three outputs by the output identifier. The outputs of the power supply are considered three logical instruments. The INSTrument command provides a mechanism to identify and select an output. When one output is selected, the other outputs are unavailable for programming until selected. The commands which are affected by the INSTrument command are output setting commands (SOURce), measurement commands (MEASure), and calibration commands (CALibration). 'P6V' is the identifier for +6V output, 'P25V' is for +25V output and 'N25V' is for -25V output."
